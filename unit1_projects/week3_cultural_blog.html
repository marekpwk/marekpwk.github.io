      <h3>Fireside Chat - reflections</h3>
      <p> I think DBC culture is great. I've read a lot about it long before I've watched this video and liked it back then. I think it not only makes people a great junior Web Developers, but is also makes them a better person. There is no competition there(just a friendly one) and you can always count on help from your teacher or other fellow boot.</p>
      <p>Although we are still in prep phase 0, I believe that we have already become part of DBC culture. When someone has a problem and posts it on our Google page, most of the time immediately couple others peers are willing to help. They are a lot of useful things I learnt already from my pairing sessions partners or from google community. Everyone is willing to share their knowledge, useful tricks in Sublime and even their fears, which I think starting to bond us as a group.</p>
      <p>To sum it up, I will repeat after Shereef: <br/><br/><strong>“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”</strong>.</p>
