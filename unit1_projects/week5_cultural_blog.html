                <h3>Too much technology</h3>
                <p>I love technology, and it's taking more and more space in my life. Well not only in my life, but in the lives of all of us. And it is not a good thing.</p>
                <p>For a simple example, I was working on my laptop in the coffeehouse and decided to take a break. I looked around and nothing unusual happened.  It was the same scenario as in every other coffeehouse, people were  smiling and talking, but there was a small detail of difference. Almost in every conversation there was some electrical device present.</p>
                <p>A couple of teenagers were playing games, sitting close to each other. But they played games on their phones, and weren't talking, acting like they were hypnotized. There was no real conversation there, something was missing.</p>
                <p>I am no better. If I have to stand in a line longer than 30 seconds, I have to pull out my phone and just look for something “really important”, i.e. browsing the web in that exact moment, so I can kill time waiting in line.</p>
                <p>I visited my friends last weekend, during the time when they put their kids to the beds. The little one asked my friend, “Daddy, it's time for the bed time story”, so I was expected that he or his wife would go to their daughter's bedroom and read her a book. How surprised I was, when my friend pull out an ipad, turned on a movie on youtube and handed the device to his daughter.</p>
                <p>What is happening? On one hand technology is helping us tremendously, and on the other it alienates us, and makes us addicted.  We forget that technology is there to help us, not to become a part of us.</p>
                <p>What can we do?</p> <p>I don't have an answer. Maybe, just once, I'll sit in a coffeehouse and enjoy the coffee, not the free wifi.</p>
