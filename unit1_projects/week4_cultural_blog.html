                <h3>Emotional Conflict</h3>

                <p>My worse emotional conflict happened a couple years ago. I was working in a team , where one guy, X, not only didn't do his job as he was supposed to, but he was acting this way on purpose. So the other people which relied on his work, couldn't do it on time.</p>
                <p>One week I was assigned to work with him directly, and it was a nightmare. We had a lot of work, and basically I had to do everything on my own. When I asked him when he was going to finish his part, he started to yell at me in front of other people saying that I "wasn't his boss", and I wasn't gonna "tell him what to do", etc. I responded the same as him, telling him what I thought about him, what whole team thought about him. We were very close to fighting each other, but fortunately it ended just at words.</p>
                <p>After this incident, he really started to work. He didn't interact much with other team members, but he was doing his job as he supposed to.</p>
                <p>If I could go back, I would asked him to have a drink or coffee with me, and would have told him everything that I screamed, but in a more polite way and friendly way. I think that would have had a much better effect than screaming at each other.
