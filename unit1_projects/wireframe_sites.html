  <h2>Google</h2>
  <p>It is designed to make searching easy, and that's what it does. No distraction there, just Google logo in the middle of the page and the search input. If you need more google apps, there are links located in top right corner.</p>

<h2>Lifehacker</h2>
  <p>Lifehacker is trying to show users a lot of interesting articules and make it easy to discover related stories. I like the stories, but I always get lost if I want to find something on Lifehacker.</p>

  <h2>Arstechnica</h2>
  <p>ArsTechnica presents the recent stories from the world of tech and science and in my opinion it is presented in a very nice and clear way.</p>
