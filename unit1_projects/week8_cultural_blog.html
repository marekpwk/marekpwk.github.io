              <h3>Pair programming</h3>
                <p>Before my first pairing session I was really stressed, never having paired with anyone , I had never solved any programming problem with a real person. I used only resources mainly , asked questions online when I didn't understand something, but I found it was totally different from pair programming.</p>
                <p>My first two pairing sessions were really figuring out how this works, like how to divide the responsibilities between navigator and the driver.</p>
                <p>I think it was after my third pairing session that I saw the real power of pair programming. Not only did we solve problem quickly, but I also benefited greatly from the knowledge of my colleague.  Also, when he was asking questions regarding my way of solving the problem, it allowed me to see it from a different and  wider perspective, which helped later in finalizing the solution.</p>
                <p>I don't know how many times I have paired since then, it has been a lot, and the only thing I can say, is that I wish I had started this earlier, because these sessions have greatly seeded my learning process.</p>
