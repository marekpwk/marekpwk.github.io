                <h3>My favourite web sites</h3>
                <p>My favorite websites are: Google, Lifehacker and ArsTechnica.</p>
                <p>Google main page is very easy to use and the design is very simple. In the middle of the page under Google logo you can find a search input, so it's really hard to miss it. If a user wants to use other google services, there are a few links in the top right corner. First link connects with Google+ profile, the second one connects with gmail, and third one leads to google image search. The fourth link expands additional menu with more apps. I think this is a really good design. The first three links connect to most used google services, so I guess that's why they are separated. The rest apps are grouped under fourth button, that way google avoids cluttering web page with dozens links and getting user confused.</p>

                <p>I really like Lifehacker's articles, but I don't like the website design. I would describe it as a messy design. I know that it resembles more blogging platform than actual news page, but still when I look at it, it looks like an disorganized page. This is a two column layout. On the right side Popular Stories are displayed, on the left column Actual Articles. At the top of the right page is a search bar, which is the only way to find archive articles(at least I haven't discovered another way). There are recommendations on similar topics under every new article . The problem I have with Lifehacker is lack of menu. I can find every article in the search bar, but it would be nice to see other options, like grouped menu for diffrent types of articles. This site has content with a a lot of topics, but they are not segregated, at least not the way I would expect. For example, it would be nice if there were tags added to the articles, it would make browsing similar articles much easier.</p>

                <p>The third website I like is ArsTechnica, technology news site. I would describe the design as simple and elegant, user can even switch from light to dark theme color. It is very easy to find an article either through search bar at the top or through menu.The menu is intuitive, I have no problem with navigation from one page to another, or finding a way back to the page where I started.</p>

                <h3>Difference between Margin, Border, and Padding</h3>
                <p><strong>Margin</strong> is a space beetween HTML elements.</p>
                <p><strong>Border</strong> is a space around an element, it can have a color, style( solid, dotted, etc ) and thickness.</p>
                <p><strong>Padding</strong> is a space beetween content and a border of the elelemnt.</p>
